# Apenzijncool
The Dutch website Apenzijncool (monkeys are cool) was the first website I have ever created. I built the first version with a website builder when I was around ten. About two years later I moved on to a version that was built with HTML, without the help of any website builder. The website contained some information about monkyes, but it was mostly an excuse to work with and learn HTML.  

Besides the main website, Apenzijncool also had a few sub websites. For example, there was a blog where I and a few other people posted stories we wrote (about monkeys, of course). It also had a forum and a chatbox, but those weren't as successful as I had hoped them to be.

This is a restored version of the site. Unfortunately, it is quite unstable. A lot of links probably won't work anymore.
